          <p>Sometimes it may be not clear which meta-data files are used for particular editing session. This information can be obtained by calling the <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Document-&gt;Document Properties</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> dialog.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When you change and save the meta-data settings for multiple opened documents of the <b>same type</b>, the <b>last</b> save is the most relevant. To see the saved changes affect the other already opened documents, you must re-open the documents, but not through the recent files list which preserves meta-data settings as they were when closing a document.</p>
        </li>

          <p>If you want to create permanent settings on the <i>Original</i>  level, first save the view as user-customized on the <i>Template</i> or <i>No-Template</i> level, and then copy the files to the Serna installation directory manually.</p>
